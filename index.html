        <b>Apple Technical Specialist:</b>
        I helped new owners get started and current users quick, efficient
        support with Apple products. I also quickly assessed customers in
        certain situations, and gave advice on the spot, ultimately helping them
        acquire the basic skills they need to get started on photo, video, and
        music projects.

      <h4>Music:</h4>
      <p style="width: 40%;">
        I would consider myself a musical nerd. All genres deserve love, and all
        kinds of music should be explored. Nirvana, Queen, Kanye West, and
        Playboi Carti are some of my biggest musical influences. I absolutely
        love music because it is also an essential factor in my life that has
        changed my mindset, and that has positively influenced my behavior.
      </p>
      <h4>Movies:</h4>
      <p style="width: 40%;">
        Most of my favorite movies have been directed by Quentin Tarantino such
        as pulp fiction and reservoir dogs. If I had to choose my all time
        favorite movie it would be Inception by Christopher Nolan.

      <p style="width: 40%;">
        I'm very fortunate enough to say that I was able to travel to diffrent
        countries, including Dubai, Egypt, and different parts of Europe like
        Italy and Greece, just to name a few. Whenever I have the opportunity to
        travel, I always return home with a new and improved mindset. Traveling
        is so important, and it is one of the reasons I behave the way that I
        do. Below is a picture I took of the giza pyramids in Cairo.
